# 🏎️ Red Bull Race Strategy Breakdown

## 📌 Summary
This project analyzes Red Bull's race strategy decisions in the 2024 F1 season, focusing on tyre choices, pit window timing, undercut opportunities, tyre degradation, and safety car scenarios.  
The goal is to understand how Red Bull consistently maximizes race performance through sharp strategic calls.

## ⏱️ What I Analyzed
- Tyre strategy and stint lengths  
- Undercut vs overcut decision points  
- Usage of clean air to gain advantage  
- Traffic management  
- Safety car and VSC reaction time  
- Fuel load and pace manipulation  

---

## 🔍 Key Strategic Highlights
- Red Bull builds strategy around **clean air** — they avoid traffic at all costs.  
- Their pit timing often forces rivals to respond early.  
- They prioritize **track position**, not tyre life.  
- They exploit **undercut windows** with strong out-laps.  
- They keep 1–2 laps extra tyre life for final push if needed.

## ❌ Rival Mistakes Red Bull Exploits
- Rivals pit too early or too late  
- Rivals leave drivers stuck in traffic  
- Poor reaction to Red Bull’s pit stop  
- Misjudging tyre warmup/degradation  
- Wrong compound at the wrong phase  

---

## ✔️ What Red Bull Did Right
- Precise pit windows (often ±1 lap accuracy)  
- Correct tyre choice based on weather and track evolution  
- Fast reaction to safety cars  
- Predicting rivals’ pace and degradation  
- Splitting strategy between drivers to cover threats

## 🧠 What I Learned
This analysis helped me understand:
- Race pace modelling  
- Clean-air strategy importance  
- Undercut/overcut calculations  
- How small timing changes flip the race  
- How elite teams like Red Bull operate their strategy room
